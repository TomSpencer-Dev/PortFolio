<h3>Portfolio Site</h3>

This page is a home page with a contact form, and links to my portfolio on GitHub. It was styled using CSS and contains a navbar, images and text with links and hover effects. It also has a muted looping video.

<h3>Space Station Site</h3>

This page is an example home page for a space travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

<h3>Movie Theater Site</h3>

This page is an example home page for a movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards and dropdowns.
